"""Provide segmentation techniques.

Segmentation techniques are used to associate areas or volumes to each
identified feature. The segmentation is implemented using watershedding
techniques from the field of image processing with a fixed threshold
value. This value has to be set specifically for every type of input
data and application. The segmentation can be performed for both
two-dimensional and three-dimensional data. At each timestep, a marker
is set at the position (weighted mean center) of each feature identified
in the detection step in an array otherwise filled with zeros. In case
of the three-dimentional watershedding, all cells in the column above
the weighted mean center position of the identified features fulfilling
the threshold condition are set to the respective marker. The algorithm
then fills the area (2D) or volume (3D) based on the input field
starting from these markers until reaching the threshold. If two or more
features are directly connected, the border runs along the
watershed line between the two regions. This procedure creates a mask 
that has the same form as the input data, with the corresponding integer 
number at all grid points that belong to a feature, else with zero. This 
mask can be conveniently and efficiently used to select the volume of each
feature at a specific time step for further analysis or visialization.

    """Adds markers for watershedding using the `features` dataframe
    to the marker_arr.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features: pandas.DataFrame
        Features for one point in time to add as markers.
    marker_arr: 2D or 3D array-like
        Array to add the markers to. Assumes a (z, h1, h2) or (h1, h2) configuration.
    seed_3D_flag: str('column', 'box')
        Seed 3D field at feature positions with either the full column
         or a box of user-set size
    seed_3D_size: int or tuple (dimensions equal to dimensions of `field`)
        This sets the size of the seed box when `seed_3D_flag` is 'box'. If it's an
        integer, the seed box is identical in all dimensions. If it's a tuple, it specifies the
        seed area for each dimension separately.
        Note: we recommend the use of odd numbers for this. If you give
        an even number, your seed box will be biased and not centered
        around the feature.
        Note: if two seed boxes overlap, the feature that is seeded will be the
        closer feature.
    level: slice or None
        If `seed_3D_flag` is 'column', the levels at which to seed the
        cells for the watershedding algorithm. If None, seeds all levels.

    Returns
    -------
    2D or 3D array like (same type as `marker_arr`)
        The marker array

    Parameters
    ----------
    field_in : iris.cube.Cube
        Input field to perform the watershedding on (2D or 3D for one
        specific point in time).

    features_in : pandas.DataFrame
        Features for one specific point in time.

    dxy : float
        Grid spacing of the input data in metres

    threshold : float, optional
        Threshold for the watershedding field to be used for the mask.
        Default is 3e-3.

    target : {'maximum', 'minimum'}, optional
        Flag to determine if tracking is targetting minima or maxima in
        the data to determine from which direction to approach the threshold
        value. Default is 'maximum'.

    level : slice of iris.cube.Cube, optional
        Levels at which to seed the cells for the watershedding
        algorithm. Default is None.

    method : {'watershed'}, optional
        Flag determining the algorithm to use (currently watershedding
        implemented). 'random_walk' could be uncommented.

    max_distance : float, optional
        Maximum distance from a marker allowed to be classified as
        belonging to that cell. Default is None.

    vertical_coord : str, optional
        Vertical coordinate in 3D input data. If 'auto', input is checked for
        one of {'z', 'model_level_number', 'altitude','geopotential_height'}
        as a likely coordinate name
    seed_3D_flag: str('column', 'box')
        Seed 3D field at feature positions with either the full column (default)
         or a box of user-set size
    seed_3D_size: int or tuple (dimensions equal to dimensions of `field`)
        This sets the size of the seed box when `seed_3D_flag` is 'box'. If it's an
        integer, the seed box is identical in all dimensions. If it's a tuple, it specifies the
        seed area for each dimension separately. Note: we recommend the use
        of odd numbers for this. If you give an even number, your seed box will be
        biased and not centered around the feature.


    Returns
    -------
    segmentation_out : iris.cube.Cube
        Mask, 0 outside and integer numbers according to track
        inside the ojects.

    features_out : pandas.DataFrame
        Feature dataframe including the number of cells (2D or 3D) in
        the segmented area/volume of the feature at the timestep.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If target is neither 'maximum' nor 'minimum'.

        If vertical_coord is not in {'auto', 'z', 'model_level_number',
                                     'altitude', geopotential_height'}.

        If there is more than one coordinate name.

        If the spatial dimension is neither 2 nor 3.

        If method is not 'watershed'.

    """Use watershedding to determine region above a threshold
    value around initial seeding position for all time steps of
    the input data. Works both in 2D (based on single seeding
    point) and 3D and returns a mask with zeros everywhere around
    the identified regions and the feature id inside the regions.

    Calls segmentation_timestep at each individal timestep of the
    input data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : pandas.DataFrame
        Output from trackpy/maketrack.

    field : iris.cube.Cube
        Containing the field to perform the watershedding on.

    dxy : float
        Grid spacing of the input data.

    threshold : float, optional
        Threshold for the watershedding field to be used for the mask.
        Default is 3e-3.

    target : {'maximum', 'minimum'}, optional
        Flag to determine if tracking is targetting minima or maxima in
        the data. Default is 'maximum'.

    level : slice of iris.cube.Cube, optional
        Levels at which to seed the cells for the watershedding
        algorithm. Default is None.

    method : {'watershed'}, optional
        Flag determining the algorithm to use (currently watershedding
        implemented). 'random_walk' could be uncommented.

    max_distance : float, optional
        Maximum distance from a marker allowed to be classified as
        belonging to that cell. Default is None.

    vertical_coord : {'auto', 'z', 'model_level_number', 'altitude',
                      'geopotential_height'}, optional
        Name of the vertical coordinate for use in 3D segmentation case

    seed_3D_flag: str('column', 'box')
        Seed 3D field at feature positions with either the full column (default)
         or a box of user-set size

    seed_3D_size: int or tuple (dimensions equal to dimensions of `field`)
        This sets the size of the seed box when `seed_3D_flag` is 'box'. If it's an
        integer, the seed box is identical in all dimensions. If it's a tuple, it specifies the
        seed area for each dimension separately. Note: we recommend the use
        of odd numbers for this. If you give an even number, your seed box will be
        biased and not centered around the feature.


    Returns
    -------
    segmentation_out : iris.cube.Cube
        Mask, 0 outside and integer numbers according to track
        inside the area/volume of the feature.

    features_out : pandas.DataFrame
        Feature dataframe including the number of cells (2D or 3D) in
        the segmented area/volume of the feature at the timestep.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If field_in.ndim is neither 3 nor 4 and 'time' is not included
        in coords.
